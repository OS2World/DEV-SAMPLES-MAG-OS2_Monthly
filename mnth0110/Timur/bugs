During targetting, the routine which generates the targetting path may
enter an infite loop.  This happens when the targetting path circles back
on itself.  Since the routine is called from the message processing routine,
the loop causes the system message queue to block.  Your only recourse is
to press Ctrl-Esc and terminate btech2.exe.

This error has been fixed in the current beta.
