Volume 1 #10
------------

o   The tentative official title of this game is BattleTech/2.  The
    main executable has been renamed to BTECH2.EXE.  GAME.C is now
    BTECH2.CPP (not MAIN.CPP as the article states). GAME.RC is now
    MAIN.RC.

o   Converted to C++.  Hexagons, 'Mechs, Maps, and Targetting are classes.
    All source files now have .cpp extensions.

o   Removed the hex grid.  All hexagons on the map now touch each other.

o   Removed the background hex-highlighting.  Since there's no map grid,
    there's no place to draw the hexagon's outline.

o   Maps can now be opened and closed for real.  The program starts out
    with no map.  Select "New" or "Open" to get one.

o   The project files have been altered such that all versions of the
    code, from now on, are in the same directory.  Previously, each month's
    code was in a different directory under C:\GAME.  Now, the source code
    belongs in C:\BTECH2, and all references to different versions are
    gone.  This means that you will have to remove all files from C:\BTECH2
    before you install this archive.

o   Not mentioned in the article is that the program has been compiled
    with IBM's C Set/2 C/C++ compiler.

o   Single-threaded library is used, since only one thread calls
    the runtime library.

o   Vertex Redirection is used to determine the targeting path.  This
    method is only about 90% effective.

o   Added an error handler for centralized error processing.  Note that
    the handler doesn't detect errors.

o   Most modules, especially HEXES and BITMAP, have been cleaned up.

o   FILES now opens/saves any files, not just terrain maps.  The map
    read and write functions are in TERRAIN, which calls FILES for the
    actual file I/O.

o   Minimizing the main window now hides the info box

o   Moving and targeting have been combined into Move/Target mode.  Left
    button moves, right button targets.

o   Targetting-specific functions moved to TARGET.

o   The drawing functions in HEXES all take presentation space handles
    as parameters.  In addition, most presentation spaces are opened and
    closed within one message.  The exception is the targeting line.

o   A new function, HexOutline(), outlines a hexagon.  It's used by the
    targeting thread.

o   The 'Mech's current position is shown in the Info Box.

o   Maps are now "opened" and "closed", not "loaded" and "saved".
    However, the close option is disable.

o   Improved performance of source hexagon highlighting on 256-color
    displays.

o   The title bar now shows the name of the current map.

o   Release/Debug version of make files are available.  A composite
    project, with two base projects, is provided.
