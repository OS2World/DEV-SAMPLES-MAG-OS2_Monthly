CORRECTIONS to the printed articles:

Volume 1 #10
------------

o   Lots of little typos everywhere.

o   The picture in the center is that of a Crusder 'Mech, created by Scott
    Cherkofsky, rendered with RayDream Designer 3.0 on a Macintosh 660AV.

Volume 1 #9
-----------

o   The diagrams have not been included.

Volume 1 #8
-----------

o   The listing under the HEXES section should read:

      for (hi.c=iStartC; hi.c<=iEndC; hi.c++)
        for (hi.r=iStartR; hi.r<=iEndR; hi.r+=2)
          HexFillDraw(hi);

    Note that this is only an approximation of what the code would look like.

Volume 1 #7
-----------

o   The article should be titled "Show me the Way," not "Paint by Numbers"
o   The list of terms was not included
o   The bio line should read:

    Timur Tabi is a digital audio hardware programmer for Editing Machines
    Corp.  He can be reached at 11811 Federalist Way #2; Fairfax, VA 22030
    or on the OS/2 Shareware BBS (Fidonet address 1:109/347)

    Sending mail to my New York address will still reach me, although
    not as quickly.

Volume 1 #6
-----------

o   The article should be titled "The Parlance of Squares,"
    not "Paint by Numbers"
o   The bio line should read:

    Timur Tabi still has the same job as last month, but he can
    now be reached at 11811 Federalist Way #2; Fairfax, VA 22030

Volume 1 #5
-----------

o   Aside from the poorly formatted side-bar on page 48, nothing's wrong.

Volume 1 #4
-----------

o   The article should be titled "You can be the Captain," which is taken
    from "Closer to the Heart", by Rush:

	You can be the captain
	And I will draw the chart
	Sailing into destiny
	Closer to the heart

o   The formatting is a bit screwy, but at least my italics are there.

Volume 1 #3
-----------

o   The article title, "In the Beginning", is not clearly indicated.
