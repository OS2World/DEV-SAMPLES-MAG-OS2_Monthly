     One of the many new features in OS/2 2.0 is a new type of menu
called the conditional cascade menu.  A conditional cascade menu is
a menu that contains one or more mutually exclusive menu options,
called a cascade.  When the cascade is displayed, a check mark
identifies the default option.  The conditional cascade menu itself
contains the menu text followed by a push button.  When the button
is selected, the cascade appears.  When the conditional cascade
menu is selected, the system takes action on the default item in
the cascade.

     One of the most common examples of a conditional cascade menu
is the folder popup menu.  The folder popup menu contains three
conditional cascade menus: "Open", "Help", and "Create another". 
Looking at "Open", if the button to "Open" is selected, the cascade
appears with four options, one of them being the default (the
default is usually "Icon View").  If an item in the cascade is
selected, the folder opens the appropriate window.  If "Open" is
selected, the default cascade item is opened.

     Listed below is a sample application that demonstrates the use
of the conditional cascade menu.  The window contains a menu called
"Strings" that, when selected, brings up a conditional cascade menu
called "Display".  If "Display", button is selected, a cascade
appears with three items called "String 1", "String 2", and "String
3".  Notice that "String 3" is the default item because that item
is checked.  If one of these items are selected, the respective
menu item string is displayed on the window.  If "Display" is
selected, the application will display "String 3" on the window,
because "String 3" is the default cascade item for "Display".

     In order to create a conditional cascade menu, the menu first
has to be set up as a standard submenu with menu items.  CASCADE.RC
lists "Display" as a submenu with "String 1" through "String 3" as
the submenu items.  CASCADE.C converts the submenu to a conditional
cascade menu when the WM_CREATE message is intercepted.  When that
message is received, a call to WinWindowFromID retrieves a handle
from the menu id.  When the handle is retrieved, the menu's
reserved word must be updated with the MS_CONDITIONALCASCADE flag,
then inserted back to the menu.  Once the word is updated, the menu
is now a conditional cascade menu.

     Now that the conditional cascade menu has been created, it is
a good idea to set the current cascade item.  When the conditional
cascade menu is created, the first cascade option becomes the
default.  But when the conditional cascade menu is created, no
check mark is automatically set to the first cascade option, so it
is a good idea to set the default option.  This is done by calling
WinSendMsg, with MM_SETDEFAULTITEMID as the message id and the
default cascade option as the first extra parameter.  The example
calls WinSendMsg with ID_STRING_3 as the default item.  The system
responds by setting "String 3" as the default option, which then a
check mark is displayed at the menu option.  If a change in the
default options is desired, just send another MM_SETDEFAULTITEMID
message with the new default menu option. 
Each time a new default option is selected, the system will remove
the check mark next the previous default and insert the mark next
to the new default option.

     Although the default option check mark is maintained by the
system, the check can be added or removed manually the same way
that standard check marks are edited.  Manually adding or removing
check marks in the cascade will not change the default item.  Each
time a new option is selected, the only cascade options that are
affected are the old and new default options.  Placing check  marks
next to non-affected cascade options will not be changed, so it is
possible to have more than one checked cascade option.

     The next item to discuss is how a conditional cascade menu
selection is processed.  For most standard menu items, if the item
is selected the corresponding item id is sent which can be
intercepted by the window's procedure.  But when a conditional
cascade menu is selected, the id of the default cascade item is
sent instead of the id of the cascade menu.  In CASCADE.RC, the
default conditional cascade menu has been assigned the id of
ID_DISPLAY, but when "Display" is selected, ID_STRING_3 is sent
because that is the id of the default cascade item.  If the default
cascade id is changed, that new id is then sent when "Display" is
selected.

     Conditional cascade menus are excellent for menu selections
that benefit from a default option.  It allows the user to select
a default option from a list of options, while still allowing the
user to select all options, if desired.
