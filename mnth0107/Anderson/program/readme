An OS/2-PM Editor Using MLE           by Brian R. Anderson

This directory contains the following files:

   EDIT.EXE    -- the OS/2 executable program
   EDIT.HLP    -- the compiled help file
   INSTALL.CMD -- the OS/2 installation batch file
   INSTALL.BAT -- the DOS installation batch file

NOTE: the batch files put EDIT.EXE into C:\OS2
                      and EDIT.HLP into C:\OS2\HELP
